        Enviro is a cross-platform mobile recycling app (written in react native) that features recyclability checks of trash on-hand, pathfinding to nearby recycling bins, earning “eco points” for recycling and vehicle-free travel, and visualizing their impact in real time through interactive charts, leaderboards, and a dynamic “mini-sanctuary”.
